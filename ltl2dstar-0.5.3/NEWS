Version 0.5.3 (more HOA support)
 * Fix HOA output for empty set of atomic propositions
 * Flexible --ltl2nba translator specification, can read HOA NBA
 * --input=nba option for determinizing directly from HOA NBA
 * --complement-input=yes/no and --trust-hoa-properties=yes/no
 * export stutter-insensitiveness property in HOA
 * parsing for HOA via cpphoafparser 0.99.1
 * Now requires C++11 compiler
 * Parse Promela neverclaims generated by Spin 6.2.4 and later
 * Refresh of generated parsers

Version 0.5.2 (Bugfix and maintenance release, add HOA support)
 * Fix computation of stutter-insensitive symbols, i.e., when
   --partial-stutter=yes is used (not activated by default).
   Could lead to incorrect automata.

 * Support for Hanoi Omega Automata Format (output).
   New command-line option --output-format can be used to generate
   automata in
    - ltl2dstar-format (--output-format=native)
    - HOAF             (--output-format=hoa)
    - DOT              (--output-format=dot)
   The old option --output=dot still works, but is only a legacy
   short-hand for
     --output=automaton --output-format=dot

 * Update included Boost C++ Libraries version to 1.57.0

 * Some code-cleanup:
   - (Named) temporary files are created with mkstemp()
   - Refactor handling of non-existing bitset index
   - Switch from unsigned int to std::size_t to reduce some 64bit
     warnings.
   - Fix compilation issues on Cygwin and newer GCC compilers.
   - Update hash map class to support various implementations
     (TR1, STD, Boost, ...), see common/hash_map.hpp
  
 * Fix some small issues in the documentation
 * Now actually support ^ (xor)
 * Search for external tool in the path (see documentation)
 * Correctly quote " in output of --detailed-states=yes
 
 * Optional infrastructure for building ltl2dstar with cmake (see README)

Version 0.5.1 (Bugfix release)
 * Fix bug in SafraTree.operator<
 * Add Plugin infrastructure

Version 0.5.0

 * Add stuttering, with command line options (see documentation):
    --stutter            Use stutter construction
    --partial-stutter    Use partial stutter

    --stutter=yes is new default.

 * Add option --automata=original-nba to output the NBA generated for
   the LTL formula

 * Several bugfixes
 
 * Update included Boost C++ Libraries version to 1.33.1


Version 0.4.2 (Bugfix release)

 * Fix compilation errors on SUN Solaris (variable name clashes)


Version 0.4.1 (Bugfix release)
